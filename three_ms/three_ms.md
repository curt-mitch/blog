When students are first introduced to the fields of probability and statistics it is usually through via the three m's: mean, median, and mode. These three numbers can give a basic window of a data set and are usually easy to determine.

# Mean
The mean of a data set is computed by adding all of the values in the data set and dividing them by the total number of members, or observations, in the data set:
  [equation of x-bar]

# Median
The median of a data set is found by ordering the values from lowest to highest and picking the middle observation. In the case where there is an even number of observations and thus no middle value, the median is the mean of the two central values, i.e. the sum of those two values divided by two:
  [equation of M]

# Mode
The mode of a data set is the number that appears most often in the data set. Another way of describing the mode is the value one is most likely to observe in the data. The mode of a set may not be unique, as more than one value may appear an equal number of times. Take the set [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]. In this case the modes of the data are 2 and 3 since both values appear twice, more than the values 1 and 4. Another property that distinguishes the mode from the mean and median is that since it does not require any arithmetic or sorting of values to find, non-numeric data sets can be said to have a mode. For instance, what last name appears most often in a phone book is an example of a non-numeric mode.
